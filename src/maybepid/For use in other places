Variables I and lasterror must be created outside the loop. Probably need to be static too.
kP, kI, kD, target, velTolerance, and posTolerance are constants (tune these).

Loop through this:
```
	if (!done){
		lasterror = error;
		error = target - position;
					
		if (Math.abs(error) < 2) {
			I = 0;
		}
		
		P = kP * error;
		I = kI * (I + error);
		D = kD * (error - lasterror);
					
		acceleration = P + I + D;
					
		velocity = (velocity + acceleration) * efficiency;
		position = position + velocity;
		
		if(Math.abs(velocity) < velTolerance && Math.abs(error) < posTolerance) {
			done = true;
		}
	}
```


NOTES on tuning:
from my trial and error I found that:
	P makes it go faster when far away, so increase it if it is going slow at long distances.
	I makes it go faster when it has been away from the target for a long time so increase it to go faster, decrease if oscillates.
	D makes it slow down when it is getting close to the target. Increase if it is oscillating and decrease if it takes too long to get there.
